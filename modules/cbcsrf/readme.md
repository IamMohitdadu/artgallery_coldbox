#WELCOME TO THE CSRF MODULE

A module that protects you against CSRF attacks by generating unique FORM/client tokens and providing your ColdBox application with new functions for protection.

##LICENSE

##SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
- Lucee 4.5+
- ColdFusion 9+

#INSTRUCTIONS

Just drop into your **modules** folder or use CommandBox to install

`box install cbcsrf`

## Mixins
This module will add the following UDFs into any framework files: 

- `generateCSRFToken()`
- `verifyCSRFToken()`

If the CF engine supports this natively, that functionality will be used.  Otherwise, a custom implementation will be used.  

## Mappings
The module also registers the following mapping in WireBox: `util@cbCSRF`

You can then use this mapping to use the `generateCSRFToken()` and `verifyCSRFToken()` functions in your models if you wish

## Example
Below is a simple example:

```js
/**
* My Event Handler Hint
*/
component {

    any function signUp( event, rc, prc ){
        // Store this in a hidden field in the form
        prc.token = generateCSRFToken();
    }

    any function signUpProcess( event, rc, prc ){
        // Verify CSFR token from form
        if( verifyCSRFToken( rc.token ) {
            // save form
        } else {
            // Something isn't right
            setNextEvent( 'handler.signup' );
        }
    }
}
```

>"Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:
By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.
And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience;
And patience, experience; and experience, hope:
And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the 
Holy Ghost which is given unto us. ." Romans 5:5
